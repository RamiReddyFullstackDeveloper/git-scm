#Installing Git In AWS
=======================

Step 1: At first, the console of the AWS server should be opened. There the following command should be executed first. This command will help to download & install Git directly at the AWS server. First, it will download the Git & then it will start installing on the server. It will take time.

 $ yum install git -y
 
Step 2: Now it will ask for permission to continue the installation. We have to insert ‘y’ to start the installation. Wait till the installation is completed.
Step 3: After installation is completed, the below command should run. This command will prompt the installed version of Git in the AWS server. Hence, the installation is completed.
	$ git --version


#Create a project in your local using below maven command
 mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.sample.webproject -DartifactId=maven-web-app -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-webapp -DinteractiveMode=false
													#here -DartifactId= = <project-name>"
#cd maven-web-app  

#then do the following commands to push maven-web-app project into central repo.

git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/RamiReddyFullstackDeveloper/maven-web-app.git
git push -u origin main
